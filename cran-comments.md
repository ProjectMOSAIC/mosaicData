## Downstream dependencies

Main downstream dependencies are also maintained by me and are being updated in
advance of the ggplot2 release that is forthcoming.  The only potential breaking
change is the renaming of a variable in one of the data sets.

Homer White, the only other author of a reverse dependency, has been notified about the
upates to this package.

Other packages in the mosaic suite will be coming over the next 48 hours.
