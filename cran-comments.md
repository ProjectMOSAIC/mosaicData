## Downstream dependencies

The only change (other than updating some documentation) is the addition of a new data set.  This should not affect downstream dependencies.


## Note

This is a first step toward submitting an updated version of ggformula.  The new data set will replace one from weatherData, which has been removed from CRAN.
