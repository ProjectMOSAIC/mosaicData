\description{
The Pioneer Valley Planning Commission (PVPC) collected data north of
Chestnut Street in Florence, MA for ninety days from April 5, 2005 to 
November 15, 2005. Data collectors set up a laser sensor, with breaks in the laser beam
recording when a rail-trail user passed the data collection station.
}
\details{
There is a potential for error when two users trigger the infrared beam at exactly the same time 
since the counter would only logs one of the crossings.  The collectors left the motion detector 
out during the winter, but because the counter drops data when the temperature falls below 14 
degrees Fahrenheit, there are no data for the coldest winter months.
